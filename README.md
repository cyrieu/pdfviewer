#A PDF Viewer!

This app allows one to upload PDF files to the server, which then stores the file
and also allows the user to view the PDF they submitted. If the user uploads
more than 1 file at a time, the app will sort the files based on filename, merge
the separate PDFs into 1 PDF, and display that to the user. If the user does not
upload anything a default PDF is shown to display how the viewer works!
